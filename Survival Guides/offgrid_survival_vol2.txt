OFF-GRID MEDICAL FIELD HANDBOOK

PRIMARY MEDICAL PRIORITIES:

Airway Breathing Circulation Infection Prevention

TRAUMA RESPONSE:

Stop bleeding: Direct pressure, tourniquet if severe.

Clean wounds: Clean water, antiseptic if available.

Immobilize fractures: Splints, minimize movement.

INFECTION CONTROL:

Hand hygiene critical. Boil instruments when possible. Isolate
contagious individuals.

COMMON OFF-GRID ILLNESSES:

Waterborne disease Respiratory infection Skin infections
Malnutrition-related illness

CHRONIC CONDITION MANAGEMENT:

Stock essential medications. Monitor diet closely. Maintain stress
control.

PREVENTION SAVES MORE LIVES THAN TREATMENT.
