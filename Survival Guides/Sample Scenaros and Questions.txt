Sample 4
There has been a massive hurricane that has damaged the roads and infrastructure in southern Florida. I have a family consisting of myself, age 52, my wife, age 50 and our daughter, age 23. I have been shot in the upper arm by a rifle and I have no access to medical care with the current situation. How do I care for my wound? The bullet has passed through making a small entrance wound in the front of my arm and a bigger exit hole in the back of my arm. I have feeling in my fingers and can move them, but there is a lot of blood and I think the bone is fractured. What do I need to do now and moving forward?
