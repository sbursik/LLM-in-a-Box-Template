Use these guides as ideas when using your LLM-in-a-Box, not as a complete guide. I do suggest printing like 10 copies of each part of the PRINTABLE CHECKLISTS and laminating them for your bugout kit. Put them in a place they are easy to find. Remember, you have a complete Survival LLM on this drive! It can dig deeper on any topic in this guides.
