COMPREHENSIVE SURVIVAL & PREPAREDNESS FIELD MANUAL
Status: Expanded for Offline Continuity

SECTION 1: SURVIVAL QUICK START GUIDE (IMMEDIATE ACTION)
Use this section for the first 72 hours of a crisis.

1. Personal Safety 

Immediate Action: Stop moving for 30 seconds. Assess your immediate surroundings (360-degree scan).

Hazard Avoidance: Stay away from windows during blasts or high winds. Avoid overpasses and unstable structures.

Zone Control: Identify "Violence Zones" (choke points, crowds, riots) and move perpendicular to their direction of travel.


Shelter: Secure a location immediately. If you cannot get home, find a structure with multiple exits and thick walls. Lock doors and blackout windows.

2. Water 

The Rule: You can survive 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, 3 weeks without food. Prioritize water over food.


Target: Minimum 1 gallon per person per day. (Half for drinking, half for hygiene/cooking).

Immediate Scavenge: Fill bathtubs and sinks immediately if pressure is still on.

Treatment: Purify all questionable water. Assume all water is contaminated until proven otherwise.

Boiling: 1 minute rolling boil (3 minutes at altitudes > 6,500 ft).

Bleach: 8 drops (1/8 tsp) of unscented bleach per gallon of clear water; 16 drops for cloudy water. Let sit for 30 mins.

3. Shelter 


Core Function: Protection from wind, rain, sun, and temperature extremes.

The 98.6°F Rule: Hypothermia can kill in hours. Stay dry.


Sleep Discipline: Establish a safe sleeping area. Elevate beds off cold floors. Implement a "fire watch" or shift-sleeping system if threats exist.

4. Medical 

Triage: Treat life-threatening bleeding first (tourniquets, pressure bandages). Treat minor injuries early to prevent sepsis.

Hygiene: In a grid-down scenario, infection is a primary killer. Wash hands before eating and after waste disposal.

5. Food 

Inventory: Count every calorie available. Do not guess.


Rationing: Start rationing immediately. Eat perishable food (fridge/freezer) first. Save dry goods (rice/beans) for later.

Security: Do not cook aromatic foods (bacon, spices) if hungry people are nearby.

6. Information 


Intelligence: Gather reliable updates via battery-operated AM/FM/Weather radio.


Verification: Avoid rumors. If you didn't see it or hear it from an official source, treat it as unverified.

7. Community 

Force Multiplier: You cannot stay awake 24/7. Trusted cooperation improves survival odds.

Team: Identify neighbors with skills (medical, mechanical, security).

8. Mindset


Panic Kills: Calm thinking saves lives. Focus on the "Next Right Step" rather than the overwhelming whole.

SECTION 2: SITUATIONAL AWARENESS FIELD MANUAL
Goal: Understand reality before acting.

Step-by-Step Assessment:

Identify Failures: Check power, water, gas, cellular, and internet. Note which are down.


Determine Scope: Is this local (your block), regional (city/state), or national?. This dictates if you stay or evacuate.

Duration Est: Guess the duration. Prepare for 3x your estimate.

Tools:

Comms: Battery/hand-crank radio (NOAA frequencies).


Navigation: Paper maps (local street map, state highway map, topographic map).

Logs: Written logbook. Record everything. Memory fails under stress.

Information Filtering Protocol:


Reliable: Official broadcasts (EAS), direct visual observation, trusted family/group members.


Unreliable: Social media rumors (if internet exists), "friend of a friend" reports, panic-induced speculation.


Field Practice: The SITREP (Situation Report) Write this daily to track trends:
+1

Date/Time:

Threats: (Weather, Looting, Disease)

Resources: (Gallons of water left, Days of food left)

Morale: (Group mental state)

Population: (Are people leaving or staying?)

SECTION 3: PERSONAL SAFETY FIELD GUIDE
Core Rule: Avoid danger rather than confront it.

Home Fortification:

Hardening: Reinforce door strikes with 3-inch screws. Block ground-level windows.


Safe Room: Designate an interior room with no windows as a fallout/ballistic shelter.


Fire: Keep fire extinguishers (ABC type) accessible on every floor. Fire services may not come.

Travel Safety:

Timing: Move during daylight to avoid ambushes and falls.

Routes: Avoid predictable routes (main highways). Stick to secondary roads or rail lines if safe.

Profile: "Gray Man" concept—look average, unimportant, and poor. Hide gear.


Conflict De-escalation:

Posture: Hands visible but not aggressive. Blade of body turned slightly away.

Voice: Low, calm, slow.


Communication: State intent clearly ("I am just passing through, I want no trouble").

Protective Habits:


EDC (Everyday Carry): Always carry a flashlight, knife, lighter, and basic medical kit.


Plan: Have a rally point and emergency contact plan for family separation.


Fitness: Maintain physical fitness; you may need to walk or run miles with a pack.

SECTION 4: SHELTER OPERATIONS GUIDE
Site Selection:

Urban: Pros: Scavenge opportunities. Cons: High competition, disease, violence.

Rural: Pros: Natural resources, low density. Cons: Help is far away, isolation.

Structural Priorities:


Envelope: Ensure weather resistance (roof leaks, drafty windows).


Ventilation: Critical if using alternative heat (wood/propane) to prevent Carbon Monoxide poisoning.


Sanitation: Designate a waste area away (at least 200 ft) from water and food.

Improvements:


Insulation: Use blankets, bubble wrap, or cardboard on windows to retain heat.


Security: Bell/can traps on entry points for early warning.

Backup Plan:

Always identify a secondary shelter (neighbor's house, public building, shed) in case your primary is compromised.

SECTION 5: WATER SURVIVAL MANUAL
Sources:


Natural: Rain capture (tarps/gutters), streams, lakes.

Hidden Home Sources: Water heater tank (turn off gas/electric first, open drain valve), toilet flush tanks (not the bowl).

Purification Methods (The Trinity):

Boiling: The gold standard. 1 minute rolling boil kills all pathogens.


Filtration: Ceramic or hollow-fiber filters (0.2 microns or smaller) remove bacteria/protozoa but not viruses.

Chemical: Bleach (sodium hypochlorite) or Iodine tablets. Follow dosage exactly.

Storage:


Containers: Food-grade plastics (HDPE #2), glass, or stainless steel.


Location: Cool, dark storage prevents algae growth.

WARNING: Untreated water is a primary killer. Dysentery and Cholera can end a survival situation rapidly.

SECTION 6: FOOD PROCUREMENT MANUAL
Short Term:


Rationing: Inventory immediately. Allocate 1200 calories/day for survival, 2000+ for heavy labor.

Consumption: Eat perishable > Canned > Dry goods.

Long Term Procurement:


Gardening: Focus on calorie-dense crops (Potatoes, Corn, Beans).

Foraging: Only eat plants you can identify with 100% certainty. The "Universal Edibility Test" is a last resort.


Trapping/Fishing: Passive gathering saves calories compared to active hunting.

Preservation:


Drying: Sun or smoke drying for meats (jerky) and fruits.


Fermentation: Sauerkraut/Kimchi preserves vegetables without power.

Nutrition:


Balance: You need Carbohydrates (energy), Protein (repair), Fats (long-burn energy).

Scurvy: Watch for vitamin deficiencies. Pine needle tea or foraged greens provide Vitamin C.

SECTION 7: HEALTH AND SANITATION MANUAL
Risks:

Infection from small cuts is a major threat without antibiotics.

Contaminated water and poor hygiene cause rapid spread of illness.

Medical Kit Essentials:

Trauma: Tourniquets, Israeli bandages, gauze.


Meds: Ibuprofen, Acetaminophen, Loperamide (anti-diarrheal), Benadryl, Antibiotic ointment.


Tools: Thermometer, tweezers, shears, medical tape.

Sanitation Protocol:

Handwashing: Mandatory before cooking and after latrine use. Use ash and water if soap runs out.

Waste: Dig latrines at least 200 feet from water sources. Cover waste with dirt/ash immediately.

Food Safety: Cook food thoroughly. Keep raw meat separate from cooked food.

SECTION 8: OFF-GRID ENERGY GUIDE
Power Options:

Solar: Best for long-term. Keep panels clean. Angle towards sun.

Batteries: Do not drain lead-acid batteries below 50%. Lithium can go lower.

Fuel: Store gasoline with stabilizer (lasts 1-2 years). Propane lasts indefinitely.

Heat & Light:

Safety: Carbon Monoxide (CO) is odorless and deadly. Ventilation is mandatory for any combustion heater.

Light: Use LED headlamps/lanterns. Avoid candles (fire risk) unless necessary.

Conservation: Aggressively conserve energy. Sleep when it's dark.

SECTION 9: TOOLS AND REPAIR GUIDE
Essentials:


Multi-tool: Pliers, wire cutters, drivers.

Cutting: Fixed blade knife (heavy work) + Folding knife (precision).


Repair: Duct tape, zip ties, paracord (550 cord), sewing kit.

Maintenance:

Hygiene for Tools: Clean dirt off tools immediately. Rust kills gear.


Lubrication: Oil metal parts (gun oil, motor oil, or even cooking oil in a pinch).

Skill Sets:


Construction: Carpentry, knot tying (Bowline, Taut-line Hitch, Square Knot).


Mending: Sewing clothing and repairing tarps.

Philosophy: Tools break. Skills are weightless. Tools + Skills = Independence.

SECTION 10: COMMUNITY & ETHICS GUIDE
Group Dynamics:


Value: Groups provide security watches, diverse skills, and emotional support.


Trust: Establish clear roles (Security, Cook, Medic, Builder).

Conflict Management:

Mediation: Resolve disputes immediately before they fester. Use a third-party mediator.


Rules: Agree on "Laws of the Camp" (e.g., no stealing, fair ration distribution).

Ethics:


Core Principles: Protect life, maintain fairness, honor agreements.


Leadership: Consensus (small groups) or Elected Leader (large groups).


Morality: Maintaining humanity prevents the group from devolving into a gang.

SECTION 11: SURVIVAL TRADE & ECONOMICS
Valuables (The New Currency):


High Value: Alcohol, tobacco, coffee, spices, hygiene products, batteries, .22LR ammo.


Services: Medical repair, shoe repair, security.

Trade Rules:

Location: Never trade at your home base. Meet at a neutral spot.

Security: Never go alone. Have "overwatch" (a guard watching from a distance).


Verification: Check goods before handing over yours.

SECTION 12: EVACUATION (BUG OUT) GUIDE
Trigger Events:

Structure is unsafe (fire/collapse).

SECTION 13: KNOWLEDGE PRESERVATION & RECOVERY
The Library:

Format: Store offline. Paper books are EMP proof. Thumb drives are compact.


Subjects: Medical manuals (Merck Manual), Gardening/Farming, Mechanics, edible plant guides.

Mental Resilience:

Expectations: Expect stress, fear, and fatigue. They are normal reactions, not weaknesses.


Routine: Maintain daily routines (meals, cleaning) to provide psychological stability.

Long-Term Recovery:


Sustainability: Shift from scavenging to producing (farming, water collection) ASAP.

Future: Focus on education and children. Teach them ethics and skills. Hope is a survival tool.

SECTION 14: APPENDIX - SPECIAL SCENARIOS
A. Civil Unrest 

Gray Man: Do not look tactical. Do not look like a victim. Look boring.

Avoidance: Stay away from protests, government buildings, and retail centers.

Curfews: Obey authorities to avoid detention, unless your life is threatened.

B. EMP / Solar Flare 


Faraday: Store backup radio/flashlight in a metal trash can with lid sealed with metal tape (insulate items inside with cardboard).

Grid: Assume power will never return. Plan for manual labor alternatives for everything.

C. Pandemic / Bio-Hazard 

Isolation: Your door is your border. No one enters, no one leaves.

Sanitation: Create a "decontamination zone" outside the door for stripping outer layers before entering.

PPE: N95 masks, gloves, eye protection.

D. Natural Disaster Checklist 

Before: Secure heavy furniture. Know gas shutoff location.

During: Drop, Cover, and Hold On (Quake) or Get Low/Interior (Tornado).
